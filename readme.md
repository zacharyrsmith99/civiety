# Civiety

A historical city-building and population management simulation game where you guide a society from its earliest days. Can be played in browswer now in very early alpha at https://civiety.vercel.app/

## Overview

Civiety is an idle simulation game that models population dynamics, resource gathering, and societal development in a pre-industrial setting. Your goal is to ensure your society's survival and prosperity by carefully managing resources, assigning workers efficiently, and navigating the challenges of food security, population growth, territory, unrest, and warfare.

## Key Features

- **Realistic Population Dynamics**: 
  - Age-based population cohorts (children, adults, elders)
  - Gender demographics with realistic fertility patterns
  - Natural deaths, aging, and births all modeled with historical accuracy
  - Population affected by food availability and other environmental factors

- **Resource Management**:
  - Food gathering and production systems

- **Occupation System**:
  - Assign your population to various jobs

- **Time-Based Simulation**:
  - Full calendar system with days, weeks, months, and years
  - Adjustable time scale to witness your society's growth

## Getting Started

1. **Initial Settlement**: Begin with a small population of adults, children, and elders.
2. **Secure Food Supply**: Assign workers to gathering and hunting to establish a sustainable food supply.
3. **Balance Labor**: As your population grows, carefully distribute workers among different occupations.
4. **Plan for Growth**: Ensure you have enough food reserves to support population growth and survive lean periods.

## Development Roadmap

- [ ] Initial building system, support for farms, housing, and the space that they take up
- [ ] Resource storage and decay
- [ ] Technology research tree
- [ ] Military mechanics including bandit raids and scouting adjacent unexplored land tiles, expansion of territory
- [ ] Random events affecting population growth, food production, and other metrics
- [ ] Possibly switch to a map that doesn't use a pure square grid for more natural looking terrain
- [ ] Cultural development and societal complexity
- [ ] Expanded building system with support for roads, walls, and other infrastructure
- [ ] Generating semi-realistic map terrain, biomes, and resources 
- [ ] Improved UI for managing later periods without the need for constant readjustment
- [ ] Other AI settlements and interactions?
